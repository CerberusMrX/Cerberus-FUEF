DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
================

This guide will help you install Cerberus FUEF on your system.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
*   Operating System: Linux (Kali Linux recommended), macOS, or Windows.
*   Python: Version 3.10 or higher.

INSTALLATION STEPS
------------------

1.  **Clone or Download**
    Download the project files to your local machine.

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    *Note: If you are on Kali Linux and encounter an "externally managed environment" error, you can either:*
    *   Create a virtual environment (recommended):
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    *   Or run the tool directly as a module without installing system-wide packages (if dependencies are already met).

3.  **Verify Installation**
    Run the help command to ensure everything is working:

    python3 -m cerberus_fuef.main --help

    You should see the Cerberus banner and a list of available commands.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
*   **Missing Module**: If you see `ModuleNotFoundError`, ensure you are running the command from the root `cerberus-fuef` directory and using `python3 -m cerberus_fuef.main`.
*   **Permission Denied**: You may need to use `sudo` if you are writing to protected directories, but avoid running as root if possible.
